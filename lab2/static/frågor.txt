1. Reduce load on server = faster service

2. Not that secure since it is in plain text. Get your token = login in as you.

3. Not now since the innerText handles that

4. We would get out from our page since it is a single page application. Handle it manually is a solution

5. You get sent back to the start page of twidder. (The home page)

6. It would put more load on the server whenever a new view is needed.

7. Depending on the operation but probably. Convienient for the client-side to know if an operation isn't excecuted.

8. It is good to be used in the way that the user (client-side) can only send data that are formated in a way that the server wants.

9. There is no need to represent data in the form of a table? More freedom of just using ordinary css.

10. You can make them smooth like any program and only load what is needed at the time depending on the state of the program.
